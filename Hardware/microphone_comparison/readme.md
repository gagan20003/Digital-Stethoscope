<h1>Sensitivity</h1>
Sensitivity, the ratio of the output value to the input pressure, is a key specification of any microphone. Microphone sensitivity is typically measured with a 1 kHz sine wave at a 94 dB sound pressure level (SPL), or 1 pascal (Pa) pressure.The magnitude of the analog or digital output signal from the microphone with that input stimulus is a measure of its sensitivity.
A high sensitivity microphone isn’t always better than a low sensitivity microphone. Sensitivity tells something about the characteristics of the microphone but not necessarily about its quality. A balance between the microphone’s noise level, clipping point, distortion, and sensitivity determines whether a microphone is a good fit for a particular application. A microphone with high sensitivity may need less preamp gain before the analog-to-digital conversion, but it may have less headroom before clipping than a microphone with lower sensitivity.
In near-field applications, such as cell phones, where the microphone is close to the sound source, a microphone with higher sensitivity is more likely to reach the maximum acoustic input, clip, and cause distortion. On the other hand, a higher sensitivity may be desirable in far-field applications, such as conference phones and security cameras, where the sound is attenuated as the distance from the source to the microphone increases.

<h2>ANALOG MEMS </h2>
The sensitivity of an analog microphone is straightforward and easy to understand. Typically specified in logarithmic units of dBV (decibels with respect to 1 V), it tells how many volts the output signal will be for a given SPL.For an analog microphone, sensitivity, in linear units of mV/Pa, can be expressed logarithmically in decibels:

where OutputAREF is the 1000 mV/Pa (1 V/Pa) reference output ratio
The output of analog microphones is referenced to 1 V rms, as rms measurements are more commonly used for comparing analog audio signal levels.

<h3>DIGITAL MEMS</h3>
Digital MEMS sensors produce a digital output signal that is quantized into discrete values. Digital MEMS sensors convert the analog signal from the sensor into a digital signal, which is then processed by a microcontroller or other digital processing unit. Digital MEMS sensors can offer many advantages over analog sensors, such as improved noise immunity, lower power consumption, and greater flexibility in signal processing. The dBFS measurement scale represents the ratio of the digital output level of the microphone to the maximum possible digital output level of the device, expressed in decibels. 
For digital microphones, sensitivity is measured as a percentage of the full-scale output that is generated by a 94 dB SPL input. For a digital microphone, the conversion equation is:

where OutputDREF is the full-scale digital output level.

Sensitivity of a digital microphone is less flexible; it depends on a single design parameter, maximum acoustic input. The sensitivity and output level of digital microphones are given as peak levels because they are referred to the full-scale digital level that is the peak value . The sensitivity must be simply the difference between this maximum acoustic signal and the 94 dB SPL reference. So, if a digital microphone’s maximum SPL is 120 dB, then its sensitivity will be –26 dBFS (94 dB – 120 dB). There is no way to tweak a design to make the digital output signal higher for a given acoustic input, unless the maximum acoustic input is lowered by the same amount.

<h4>SNR</h4>
Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a measure of the difference between the level of a desired audio signal and the level of background noise in an audio system or recording. In general, a higher SNR indicates that the audio signal is stronger relative to the background noise, which can lead to a clearer and more accurate representation of the desired sound source. A lower SNR, on the other hand, can result in a higher level of background noise and a lower-quality audio signal.
